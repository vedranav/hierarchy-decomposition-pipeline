# Hierarchy decomposition pipeline

Hierarchy decomposition pipeline is a supervised machine learning tool that constructs random forest ensembles from data sets with hierarchical class.

<img src = "images/HMC_dataset.png" alt = "Data set with hierarchical class" width = "500">

Suitable data sets have:
- Class labels organised in a hierarchy
- Hierarchy in the shape of a tree or directed acyclic graph
- Examples annotated with one or several paths from the hierarchy

## Features

- Five algorithms that construct ensemble models from data sets with hierarchical class
- Tool for comparing algorithms' predictive performances in cross-validation
- Tool for predicting paths from the hierarchy that best describe unlabelled examples
- Tool that computes data set properties

## Quick start

- Prerequisite to run the pipeline is [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Download the JAR file](https://github.com/vedranav/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/releases/download/v0.0.1/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline-0.0.1.jar)
- [Download a data set from the repository](https://vedranav.github.io/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/inputs/repository.html) or use your own data set in [HARFF format](https://vedranav.github.io/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/inputs/dataset.html)
- [Create settings file](https://vedranav.github.io/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/pipeline/jar.html)
- Assuming that the JAR file and settings file (e.g., named settings.s) are in the same folder, run the pipeline by typing:
```
java -jar hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline-0.0.1.jar settings.s
```

## Reference

The pipeline is based on ideas presented in the following paper:
