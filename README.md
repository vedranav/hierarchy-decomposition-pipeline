# Hierarchy decomposition pipeline

Hierarchy decomposition pipeline is a supervised machine learning tool that constructs random forest ensembles from data sets with hierarchical class.

![Data set with hierarchical class](https://vedranav.github.io/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/images/HMC_dataset.png)

Suitable data sets have:
- Class labels organised in a hierarchy
- Hierarchy in the shape of a tree or directed acyclic graph
- Examples annotated with one or several paths from the hierarchy

## Features

- Five algorithms that construct ensemble models from data sets with hierarchical class
- Tool that estimates models' predictive performance using cross-validation
- Tool for predicting paths from the hierarchy that best describe unlabelled examples

The pipeline is described in more detail on [project website](https://vedranav.github.io/hierarchy-decomposition-pipeline/).
