# Hierarchy decomposition pipeline

Hierarchy decomposition pipeline is a supervised machine learning tool that constructs random forest ensembles from data sets with hierarchical class.

Suitable data sets have:
- Class labels organized in a hierarchy
- Hierarchy in the shape of a tree or directed acyclic graph
- Examples annotated with one or several paths from the hierarchy

## Features

- Five algorithms for constructing ensemble models from data sets with hierarchical class
- Tool for comparing algorithms' predictive performances in cross-validation
- Tool for annotating unlabelled examples
